/**
 * FIREBASESERVICEAPISERVICE ERROR FIX SUMMARY
 * ===========================================
 * 
 * Issue: Error fetching data: [ReferenceError: Property 'FirebaseServiceApiService' doesn't exist]
 * 
 * Root Cause:
 * -----------
 * The FirebaseServiceApiService class was defined with static methods, but the export 
 * was trying to bind them as if they were instance methods using .bind(). Since static 
 * methods belong to the class itself and not instances, using .bind() was causing the 
 * reference error.
 * 
 * Original problematic code:
 * -------------------------
 * const firebaseHospitalServices = {
 *   getServices: FirebaseServiceApiService.getServices.bind(FirebaseServiceApiService),
 *   createService: FirebaseServiceApiService.createService.bind(FirebaseServiceApiService),
 *   // ... other methods with .bind()
 * };
 * 
 * Fixed code:
 * -----------
 * const firebaseHospitalServices = {
 *   getServices: FirebaseServiceApiService.getServices,
 *   createService: FirebaseServiceApiService.createService,
 *   // ... other methods without .bind()
 * };
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * ------------
 * Static methods are called directly on the class and don't need binding since they
 * don't rely on 'this' context. The .bind() operation was failing because it was
 * trying to create a bound function from a static method reference.
 * 
 * Files Modified:
 * ---------------
 * - src/services/firebaseHospitalServices.js
 *   - Removed .bind(FirebaseServiceApiService) from all service method exports
 *   - Removed .bind(FirebaseDoctorService) from all doctor method exports
 * 
 * Expected Result:
 * ----------------
 * - The "Property 'FirebaseServiceApiService' doesn't exist" error should be resolved
 * - All service operations (getServices, createService, etc.) should work properly
 * - All doctor operations (getDoctors, createDoctor, etc.) should work properly
 * - Firebase integration should function normally
 * 
 * Testing:
 * --------
 * To verify the fix:
 * 1. App should start without the ReferenceError
 * 2. Services page should load properly
 * 3. Doctor management should work
 * 4. Service assignment functionality should be operational
