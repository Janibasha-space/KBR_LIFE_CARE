# Additional Assets Needed

To complete the React Native app setup, you'll need to add these standard Expo assets to your `assets/` folder:

## Required Expo Assets

1. **icon.png** (1024x1024px) - App icon
2. **splash.png** - Splash screen image
3. **adaptive-icon.png** (1024x1024px) - Android adaptive icon
4. **favicon.png** (48x48px) - Web favicon

## Current Assets in Your Folder

- **hospital-logo.jpeg**: Main hospital logo and branding image
  - Used across all login/splash screens
  - Professional medical imagery
  - High resolution for all screen densities
âœ… **Gemini_Generated_Image_5ppbdb5ppbdb5ppb.png** - Used for onboarding and profile

## Asset Usage in App

- **Splash Screen**: Uses "KBR Hospital Sam image.jpeg" as the main logo
- **Onboarding**: Uses both images for feature illustration
- **Login Screen**: Uses hospital logo for branding
- **Home Screen**: Hospital banner and branding
- **Profile Screen**: Default user avatar

## Recommended Asset Sizes

- **App Icon**: 1024x1024px (PNG, no transparency)
- **Splash Screen**: 1242x2436px (iPhone X resolution)
- **Adaptive Icon**: 1024x1024px (foreground should fit in 1024x1024px circle)

## Asset Optimization Tips
