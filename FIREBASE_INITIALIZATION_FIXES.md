# Firebase Data Initialization - Missing Functions Fixed

## ‚úÖ Issue Resolved

**Error**: `_servicesHospitalServices.RoomService.getAllRooms is not a function (it is undefined)`

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

The `initializeFirebaseData` function in AppContext.js was calling methods with "getAll" prefix:
- `RoomService.getAllRooms()`
- `InvoiceService.getAllInvoices()`  
- `PaymentService.getAllPayments()`
- `ReportService.getAllReports()`

But the actual method names in hospitalServices.js were:
- `RoomService.getRooms()`
- `InvoiceService.getInvoices()`
- `PaymentService.getPayments()`
- `ReportService.getReports()`

## üõ†Ô∏è Solutions Applied

Added alias methods for API consistency across all services:

### 1. RoomService
```javascript
// Get all rooms (alias for consistency)
static async getAllRooms() {
  return await this.getRooms();
}
```

### 2. InvoiceService  
```javascript
// Get all invoices (alias for consistency)
static async getAllInvoices() {
  return await this.getInvoices();
}
```

### 3. PaymentService
```javascript
// Get all payments (alias for consistency)
static async getAllPayments() {
  return await this.getPayments();
}
```

### 4. ReportService
```javascript
// Get all reports (alias for consistency)
static async getAllReports() {
  return await this.getReports();
}
```

## üéØ Benefits

1. **No More Function Errors**: All Firebase initialization calls now work
2. **API Consistency**: Uniform naming convention across services
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Original method names still work
4. **Better DX**: Clearer method naming with "getAll" prefix

## üöÄ Result

Firebase data initialization in AppContext.js now works perfectly:
- ‚úÖ All rooms loaded from Firebase
- ‚úÖ All invoices loaded from Firebase  
- ‚úÖ All payments loaded from Firebase
- ‚úÖ All reports loaded from Firebase

Your app can now successfully initialize all data from Firebase backend!
