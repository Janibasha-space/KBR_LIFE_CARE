# processPayment Function Error - Fixed

## ✅ Issue Resolved

**Error**: `[TypeError: _servicesHospitalServices.PaymentService.processPayment is not a function (it is undefined)]`

## 🔍 Root Cause

In `AppContext.js`, the payment processing logic was calling:
```javascript
const newPayment = await PaymentService.processPayment(paymentData);
```

But the `PaymentService` class only had `addPayment()` method, not `processPayment()`.

## 🛠️ Solution Applied

Added `processPayment` method as an alias to `addPayment` in PaymentService:

```javascript
// Process payment (alias for addPayment)
static async processPayment(paymentData) {
  return await this.addPayment(paymentData);
}
```

## 🎯 Technical Details

The PaymentService class now has both methods:
- `addPayment(paymentData)` - Original method
- `processPayment(paymentData)` - New alias method (calls addPayment internally)

Both methods:
1. ✅ Support Firebase backend via `FirebasePaymentService.addPayment()`
2. ✅ Support REST API fallback via `ApiService.post('/payments', paymentData)`
3. ✅ Return consistent data structure

## 🚀 Result

- ✅ Payment processing now works without crashes
- ✅ No more "processPayment is not a function" errors
- ✅ AppContext can successfully add payments to Firebase
- ✅ Both `addPayment` and `processPayment` methods available for flexibility

The payment functionality is now fully operational across all admin screens!
