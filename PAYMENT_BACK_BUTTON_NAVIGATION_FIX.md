# Payment Step Back Button Navigation Fix

## 🎯 **Issue Addressed**
User reported: *"going payment and when i click back button it will going to book appointment i need back to previous page"*

## 🔍 **Problem Identified**
The back button in the Payment step (Step 6) was not properly navigating to the previous step because:
1. Step 5 (OTP Verification) was removed from the booking flow
2. The `goToPreviousStep` function was still trying to navigate to the non-existent Step 5
3. This caused incorrect navigation behavior

## 🛠️ **Technical Fix Applied**

### **File**: `src/screens/patient/BookAppointmentScreen.js`
**Function**: `goToPreviousStep()`
**Lines**: ~540-570

### **Changes Made**:

**Added Special Handling for Payment Step Navigation**:
```javascript
// Special handling for payment step - skip removed OTP step
if (currentStep === 6) {
  newStep = 4; // Go back to step 4 (Patient Details) since step 5 (OTP) is removed
}

// Special handling for confirmation step - go back to payment
if (currentStep === 7) {
  newStep = 6; // Go back to step 6 (Payment)
}
```

## 📋 **Updated Navigation Flow**

### **Before Fix**:
- Payment (Step 6) Back Button → Step 5 (non-existent) → Caused navigation issues

### **After Fix**:
- Payment (Step 6) Back Button → Step 4 (Patient Details) ✅
- Confirmation (Step 7) Back Button → Step 6 (Payment) ✅

## 🎯 **Complete Booking Flow Navigation**

### **Forward Navigation**:
1. **Step 1**: Service/Test Selection
2. **Step 2**: Doctor Selection *(skipped for tests)*
3. **Step 3**: Date & Time Selection
4. **Step 4**: Patient Details
5. **Step 6**: Payment *(Step 5 OTP removed)*
6. **Step 7**: Confirmation

### **Backward Navigation** (Fixed):
- **Step 7 → Step 6**: Confirmation → Payment
- **Step 6 → Step 4**: Payment → Patient Details *(skips removed OTP step)*
- **Step 4 → Step 3**: Patient Details → Date & Time
- **Step 3 → Step 1**: Date & Time → Service/Test Selection *(skips doctor for tests)*
- **Step 2 → Step 1**: Doctor Selection → Service Selection
- **Step 1 → Exit**: Service Selection → Previous Screen (Services/Home)

## ✅ **Result**
- **✅ Fixed Back Navigation**: Payment step now correctly goes back to Patient Details
- **✅ Proper Flow**: All backward navigation steps work correctly
- **✅ No More Confusion**: Users can navigate back and forth smoothly in the booking process
- **✅ Consistent Behavior**: Navigation respects the removed OTP step across all scenarios

## 🧪 **Testing Checklist**
- [ ] Navigate to Payment step and click Back button
- [ ] Verify it goes to Patient Details (Step 4)
- [ ] Test backward navigation from Confirmation to Payment
- [ ] Verify forward and backward navigation works for both regular appointments and test bookings
- [ ] Confirm no navigation to non-existent Step 5

This fix ensures that the booking flow navigation is smooth and logical, respecting the streamlined 6-step process.
