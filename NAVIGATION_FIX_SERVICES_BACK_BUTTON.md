# Navigation Fix: Services → BookAppointment → Back to Services

## Problem Fixed
Users navigating from Services page to BookAppointment page were being taken back to Home page instead of Services page when clicking the back button.

## Root Cause
The BookAppointment screen exists in both:
1. Tab Navigator (direct access)
2. Stack Navigator (navigation from other screens)

When navigating Services → BookAppointment, the back navigation wasn't properly configured to return to Services.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. ✅ Added Navigation Source Tracking
**ServicesScreen.js changes:**
- Added `navigationSource: 'Services'` and `previousScreen: 'Services'` to all BookAppointment navigation calls
- This allows BookAppointment to know where it came from

### 2. ✅ Enhanced AppHeader Back Button
**BookAppointmentScreen.js changes:**
- Updated `customBackAction` in AppHeader to check navigation source
- If source is 'Services', navigates back to `PatientMain → Services`
- Otherwise uses normal navigation.goBack()

### 3. ✅ Fixed "Back to Services" Buttons
**BookAppointmentScreen.js changes:**
- Updated all "Back to Services" button onPress handlers
- Now explicitly navigate to `PatientMain → Services` instead of using goBack()

### 4. ✅ Added Android Hardware Back Button Handling
**BookAppointmentScreen.js changes:**
- Added BackHandler useEffect hook
- Handles hardware back button properly based on navigation source
- Prevents default behavior when appropriate

### 5. ✅ Enhanced goToPreviousStep Function
**BookAppointmentScreen.js changes:**
- Modified to handle step 1 navigation back to source
- Checks navigation source when at step 1
- Maintains normal multi-step behavior for other steps

## Navigation Flow Now Fixed

### ✅ Before Fix (Broken):
```
Home → Services → BookAppointment → [Back Button] → Home ❌
```

### ✅ After Fix (Working):
```
Home → Services → BookAppointment → [Back Button] → Services ✅
```

## All Back Navigation Methods Fixed:
1. **Header back button** - Works ✅
2. **"Back to Services" buttons** - Work ✅
3. **Android hardware back button** - Works ✅
4. **Multi-step navigation** - Still works ✅

## Files Modified:
- ✅ `src/screens/patient/ServicesScreen.js` - Added navigation source params
- ✅ `src/screens/patient/BookAppointmentScreen.js` - Enhanced back navigation logic

## Testing:
The fix ensures that no matter how users try to go back from BookAppointment screen (header button, screen buttons, or hardware back button), they will return to Services page when they came from Services, while maintaining normal navigation for other entry points.
