# getUpcomingAppointments Function Error - FIXED

## 🎯 **Error Identified**
```
ERROR: getUpcomingAppointments is not a function (it is undefined)
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
The `getUpcomingAppointments` function was defined in `UserContext.js` but was missing from `UnifiedAuthContext.js`, which is what the `AppointmentScreen.js` was trying to import from.

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **Added Missing Functions to UnifiedAuthContext.js:**

1. **`getUpcomingAppointments()`** - Returns future appointments that are confirmed/scheduled
2. **`getPastAppointments()`** - Returns past appointments or completed/cancelled ones  
3. **`cancelAppointment(appointmentId)`** - Allows cancelling appointments

### **Features:**
- ✅ **Null Safety** - Handles cases where user has no appointments
- ✅ **Authentication Check** - Only works for logged-in users
- ✅ **Date Parsing** - Safely handles appointment dates
- ✅ **Status Filtering** - Filters by appointment status correctly
- ✅ **Error Handling** - Gracefully handles malformed appointment data
- ✅ **Logging** - Provides console logs for debugging

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### **For Logged-in Users:**
```javascript
getUpcomingAppointments() 
  ↓ 
Gets user appointments from authState.user.appointments
  ↓
Filters for future dates + active status
  ↓
Returns array of upcoming appointments
```

### **For Non-logged-in Users:**
```javascript
getUpcomingAppointments() 
  ↓ 
Checks authentication status
  ↓
Returns empty array []
  ↓
Logs "User not authenticated"
```

## 📱 **Expected Behavior**

### **AppointmentScreen.js will now:**
- ✅ **Load without errors** - No more "function is undefined" errors
- ✅ **Show appointments** - If user has booked appointments, they'll display
- ✅ **Handle empty state** - Shows appropriate message when no appointments
- ✅ **Work for all users** - Logged in or not

## 🔧 **Function Signatures**

```javascript
// Get upcoming appointments
getUpcomingAppointments(): Appointment[]

// Get past appointments  
getPastAppointments(): Appointment[]

// Cancel an appointment
cancelAppointment(appointmentId: string): Promise<{success: boolean, message: string}>
```

## 🎉 **Result**

**The AppointmentScreen should now load without errors!**

### **What Users Will See:**
- **With Appointments:** List of upcoming and past appointments
- **No Appointments:** "No appointments found" or similar empty state
- **Not Logged In:** Prompt to log in to view appointments

The error is completely resolved and the appointment management functions are now properly available throughout the app! 🎊
