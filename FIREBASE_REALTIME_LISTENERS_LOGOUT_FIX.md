# Firebase Real-time Listeners Logout Fix

## Problem
After admin and patient logout, Firebase real-time listeners (specifically for invoices) continued running and attempting to access Firebase collections without proper authentication, causing these errors:

```
ERROR ❌ Invoices real-time listener error: [FirebaseError: Missing or insufficient permissions.]
LOG 🧾 Real-time invoices update: 0 invoices (permission denied)
```

## Root Cause
The real-time listeners were being set up correctly but were not properly cleaned up when users logged out. The Firebase `onSnapshot` listeners continued running in the background even after authentication was cleared, leading to permission denied errors when they tried to access protected collections.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Logout Cleanup in AppContext (`src/contexts/AppContext.js`)

#### A. Modified `clearUserData()` function:
- Added immediate cleanup of all real-time listeners during logout
- Clear both user-specific data and real-time collections data
- Reset listener state flags

```javascript
const clearUserData = () => {
  console.log('🚪 Clearing user data on logout');
  
  // Immediately clean up all real-time listeners
  console.log('🧹 Cleaning up real-time listeners on logout...');
  Object.values(unsubscribeFunctions).forEach(unsubscribe => {
    if (typeof unsubscribe === 'function') {
      try {
        unsubscribe();
        console.log('✅ Real-time listener cleaned up on logout');
      } catch (error) {
        console.log('⚠️ Error cleaning up listener on logout:', error.message);
      }
    }
  });
  setUnsubscribeFunctions({});
  setListenersActive(false);
  
  // Clear all data including real-time collections
  setAppState(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    currentUser: null,
    currentPatient: null,
    isAuthenticated: false,
    userRole: null,
    appointments: [],
    medicalReports: [],
    invoices: [],
    payments: [],
    discharges: [],
    rooms: [],
    patients: []
  }));
};
```

#### B. Enhanced Auth State Listener:
- Added immediate listener cleanup when user signs out
- Force clean all listeners before clearing user data
- Clear real-time data to prevent stale information

```javascript
const unsubscribeAuth = onAuthStateChanged(auth, async (user) => {
  if (user) {
    // User authenticated - setup listeners
    await setCurrentUser(user);
    setupRealTimeListeners();
  } else {
    console.log('👤 User signed out - immediately cleaning up real-time listeners...');
    
    // Immediately clean up all listeners to prevent permission errors
    Object.values(unsubscribeFunctions).forEach(unsubscribe => {
      if (typeof unsubscribe === 'function') {
        try {
          unsubscribe();
          console.log('✅ Real-time listener force cleaned up');
        } catch (error) {
          console.log('⚠️ Error force cleaning up listener:', error.message);
        }
      }
    });
    setUnsubscribeFunctions({});
    setListenersActive(false);
    
    // Clear user data and real-time collections
    await setCurrentUser(null);
    setAppState(prev => ({
      ...prev,
      rooms: [],
      patients: [],
      invoices: [],
      doctors: prev.doctors || [], // Keep doctors as they might be public
      services: prev.services // Keep services as they're static
    }));
  }
});
```

### 2. Added Authentication Guards to Real-time Listeners

Enhanced all real-time listeners with authentication checks to prevent them from processing updates when users are not authenticated:

```javascript
// Example for invoices listener
const invoicesUnsubscribe = firebaseHospitalServices.subscribeToInvoices((result) => {
  // Add authentication check - this is crucial for preventing permission errors
  const { auth } = require('../config/firebase.config');
  if (!auth.currentUser) {
    console.log('🚫 Invoices listener: User not authenticated, ignoring update');
    return;
  }
  
  // Process the update only if user is authenticated
  if (result.success) {
    // Handle successful update...
  }
});
```

### 3. Improved Logout Process in UnifiedAuthContext (`src/contexts/UnifiedAuthContext.js`)

Modified the logout function to:
- Clear auth state immediately to trigger listener cleanup
- Add delay to ensure auth state change is processed
- Provide better logging for debugging

```javascript
const logout = async () => {
  try {
    // Firebase logout
    if (authState.authMode === 'firebase') {
      await AuthService.logout();
    }
    
    // Clear storage
    await AsyncStorage.multiRemove([/* cached data */]);
    
    // Clear local state FIRST to trigger auth state change immediately
    setAuthState({
      isAuthenticated: false,
      isLoading: false,
      user: null,
      authMode: 'demo',
      error: null
    });
    
    // Add delay to ensure auth state change is processed
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('🔄 Auth state change should have triggered listener cleanup');
    }, 100);
    
    return { success: true, message: 'Logged out successfully from all accounts' };
  } catch (error) {
    // Force cleanup even on error
    setAuthState({ /* clean state */ });
    return { success: true, message: 'Logout completed (with cleanup)' };
  }
};
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Immediate Listener Cleanup**
- Real-time listeners are now cleaned up immediately when logout is detected
- No more background listeners trying to access Firebase without authentication

### 2. **Authentication Guards**
- All listener callbacks now check for authenticated user before processing updates
- Prevents permission errors even if listeners somehow remain active

### 3. **Comprehensive Data Clearing**
- Both user-specific data and real-time collection data are cleared on logout
- Prevents showing stale data from previous sessions

### 4. **Better Error Handling**
- Improved error logging and recovery during cleanup
- Graceful handling of cleanup failures

### 5. **State Management**
- Proper reset of listener state flags
- Clear separation between public data (services, doctors) and protected data (invoices, patients)

## Expected Result

After this fix:
- ✅ No more "Permission denied" errors after logout
- ✅ Real-time listeners properly stop when users log out
- ✅ No background Firebase queries without authentication
- ✅ Clean slate when users log back in
- ✅ Proper data isolation between user sessions

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Login as admin/patient**
2. **Verify real-time listeners are working** (see data updates)
3. **Logout completely**
4. **Verify no permission errors in logs**
5. **Login again and verify fresh data loads**

## Log Messages to Watch For

**During logout:**
- `🚪 Clearing user data on logout`
- `🧹 Cleaning up real-time listeners on logout...`
- `✅ Real-time listener cleaned up on logout`
- `👤 User signed out - immediately cleaning up real-time listeners...`

**After logout (should NOT see):**
- ❌ `ERROR ❌ Invoices real-time listener error: [FirebaseError: Missing or insufficient permissions.]`
- ❌ `LOG 🧾 Real-time invoices update: 0 invoices (permission denied)`

**During login:**
- `✅ User authenticated - setting up real-time listeners...`
- `🔄 Setting up invoices real-time listener...`
- `✅ Real-time listeners setup complete with authentication guards`

## Files Modified

1. `src/contexts/AppContext.js`
   - Enhanced `clearUserData()` function
   - Improved auth state listener
   - Added authentication guards to all real-time listeners

2. `src/contexts/UnifiedAuthContext.js`
   - Enhanced logout function for immediate state clearing
   - Added timing considerations for auth state propagation

This fix ensures that Firebase real-time listeners are properly managed throughout the entire authentication lifecycle, preventing permission errors and ensuring clean user sessions.
