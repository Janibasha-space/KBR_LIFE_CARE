# âœ… HEADER TITLE TRUNCATION FIX - COMPLETE

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved:
The header title "KBR Life Care Hospit..." was being truncated instead of showing the full name "KBR Life Care Hospitals".

## ðŸ”§ Changes Made:

### 1. **Responsive Font Sizing:**
- **Mobile**: 13px font size (was 16px)
- **Tablet**: 16px font size  
- Reduced letter spacing for better text fitting

### 2. **Layout Optimization:**
- Reduced margins and padding throughout header
- **Logo size**: 22px (mobile) / 28px (tablet) 
- **Logo margin**: 6px (mobile) / 8px (tablet)
- Optimized titleContainer flex properties

### 3. **Space Distribution:**
- Reduced `marginRight` in headerCenter from 4px to 2px
- Reduced `marginRight` in titleContainer from 10px to 5px
- Added `minWidth: 0` for proper flex shrinking
- Set `maxWidth: '100%'` instead of `'95%'`

### 4. **Tablet Responsiveness:**
- Added device detection: `const isTablet = width >= 768`
- Responsive styling for both font sizes and logo dimensions
- Better letter spacing on tablets

## ðŸ“± Results:
- âœ… **Full hospital name displays**: "KBR Life Care Hospitals" 
- âœ… **Works on all devices**: Mobile phones and tablets
- âœ… **Responsive design**: Larger text on tablets, optimized on phones
- âœ… **Professional appearance**: Clean, readable header layout

## ðŸŽ‰ Impact:
The hospital name now displays completely without truncation, providing better brand visibility and professional appearance across all device sizes!
