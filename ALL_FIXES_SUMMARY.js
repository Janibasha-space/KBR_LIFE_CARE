/**
 * COMPREHENSIVE ERROR FIXES SUMMARY
 * ==================================
 * 
 * Issues Fixed:
 * 1. ‚ùå doctors.map is not a function error
 * 2. ‚ùå Property 'FirebaseServiceApiService' doesn't exist error  
 * 3. ‚ùå Duplicate export syntax error
 * 
 * =================================================================
 * 
 * FIX 1: doctors.map is not a function
 * ------------------------------------
 * 
 * Problem: 
 * - Firebase getDoctors() returns {success: true, data: [...]}
 * - Screens were using response directly instead of extracting data array
 * - Result: doctors.map() failed because doctors was an object, not array
 * 
 * Solution:
 * - Updated DoctorsScreen.js loadDoctors() method
 * - Updated BookAppointmentScreen.js loadFirebaseData() method  
 * - Added proper response handling: doctorsResponse.data
 * - Added safety checks: doctors && doctors.length > 0
 * 
 * Files Modified:
 * ‚úÖ src/screens/patient/DoctorsScreen.js
 * ‚úÖ src/screens/patient/BookAppointmentScreen.js
 * 
 * =================================================================
 * 
 * FIX 2: Property 'FirebaseServiceApiService' doesn't exist
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * Problem:
 * - FirebaseServiceApiService class defined with static methods
 * - Export was using .bind() on static methods unnecessarily
 * - Import statements expected FirebaseServiceApiService to be available
 * 
 * Solution:
 * - Removed .bind() from static method references in firebaseHospitalServices export
 * - Added FirebaseServiceApiService to named exports
 * - Static methods are now directly referenced without binding
 * 
 * Files Modified:
 * ‚úÖ src/services/firebaseHospitalServices.js
 * 
 * =================================================================
 * 
 * FIX 3: Duplicate export syntax error
 * ------------------------------------
 * 
 * Problem:
 * - FirebaseServiceApiService was exported twice in same export statement
 * - JavaScript doesn't allow duplicate exported identifiers
 * 
 * Solution:
 * - Removed duplicate FirebaseServiceApiService export
 * - Kept only one direct export of FirebaseServiceApiService
 * 
 * Final Export Structure:
 * export {
 *   FirebaseAppointmentService as AppointmentService,
 *   FirebasePatientService as PatientService,
 *   FirebaseDoctorService,
 *   FirebaseServiceApiService,  // ‚Üê Fixed: Only one export
 *   FirebaseHospitalServiceManager,
 *   FirebaseTestService,
 *   firebaseHospitalServices
 * };
 * 
 * =================================================================
 * 
 * CURRENT STATUS:
 * ‚úÖ App starts without syntax errors
 * ‚úÖ Firebase services properly exported and importable
 * ‚úÖ Doctor loading handles response format correctly  
 * ‚úÖ Service loading handles response format correctly
 * ‚úÖ All static method references work without binding issues
 * 
 * EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
 * üöÄ App should load successfully
 * üìä Doctors screen should display all doctors properly
 * ‚öïÔ∏è  Services screen should load with assigned doctors
 * üîß Admin dashboard should allow doctor/service management
 * üîÑ Real-time updates should work across all screens
 * 
 * TESTING:
 * To verify all fixes:
 * 1. Open app - should load without errors
 * 2. Go to Doctors screen - should show list of doctors
 * 3. Go to Services screen - should show services with doctors
 * 4. Admin dashboard - should allow adding/editing doctors and services
 * 5. Check console - should see Firebase success logs, no error logs
 *
