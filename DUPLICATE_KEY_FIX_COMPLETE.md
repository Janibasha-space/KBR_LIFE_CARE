# Duplicate Key Error Fix - Complete

## Issue Summary
The React Native app was showing errors related to duplicate keys in both the payment management screen and the example API usage screen. This occurs when multiple React components in a list share the same "key" prop, which React uses to track component identity and changes.

## Root Causes
1. The FlatList component was using `keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}`, but some of the items may have had duplicate IDs
2. The payment transformation logic was generating potentially non-unique IDs
3. Child components within the list weren't using unique keys
4. Several components were using array index as key (in ExampleApiUsageScreen.js)
5. The application was not properly handling the distinction between generated IDs and original IDs when making API calls

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced FlatList Key Generation
```javascript
keyExtractor={(item, index) => `payment-card-${item.originalId || 'none'}-${index}`}
```
- Now uses both the original ID and the index position
- Added a fallback ('none') when originalId is missing
- Added unique prefix ('payment-card-') to avoid conflicts with other lists

### 2. Added Explicit View Keys
Added explicit keys to parent views in the renderItem function:
```javascript
<View key={`payment-view-${index}`} style={[styles.paymentCard, /* styles */]}>
```

### 3. Improved Payment List Transformation
- Enhanced deduplication using a more reliable key generation strategy
- Added logging for duplicate payment detection
- Added timestamp to generated IDs to ensure uniqueness
- Added the index as an additional uniqueness factor
- Ensured each payment has a stable and unique ID

### 4. Added Unique Keys to Action Buttons
Each action button now has its own unique key:
```javascript
<TouchableOpacity 
  key={`view-btn-${item.id}-${index}`}
  // other props
>
```

### 5. Fixed ID Handling in API Calls
- Modified `handleUpdatePaymentStatus` to properly detect and use original IDs
- Updated `handleDeletePayment` to always use original IDs
- Enhanced `generateInvoiceForPayment` to search for payments with both original and generated IDs

### 6. Fixed Index-Based Keys in Example Screen
In ExampleApiUsageScreen.js:
- Replaced array index used as key with unique key combining ID and index:

```javascript
// Before
<Text key={index} style={styles.listItem}>

// After
<Text key={`appointment-${appointment.id || appointment.dateTime}-${index}`} style={styles.listItem}>
```

- Same fix applied to doctors list rendering

## Results
These changes ensure that:
1. React can properly track and update components
2. No duplicate keys are used in lists
3. API calls use the correct IDs
4. The payment management screen renders correctly without React key errors

## Best Practices for Avoiding Key Issues
1. Always include an index in your key when mapping over arrays
2. Prefer using stable, unique identifiers from your data
3. Add prefixes to keys to distinguish different component types
4. Use proper key extraction functions with FlatList
5. Ensure nested components also have unique keys
