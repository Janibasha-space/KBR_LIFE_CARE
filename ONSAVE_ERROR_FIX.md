# onSave Function Error - Fixed

## ✅ Issue Resolved

**Error**: `[TypeError: onSave is not a function (it is undefined)]`

## 🔍 Root Cause

In `PaymentManagementScreen.js`, the `AddPaymentModal` component was receiving the wrong prop name:

❌ **Incorrect**:
```javascript
<AddPaymentModal
  visible={showAddModal}
  onClose={() => setShowAddModal(false)}
  onSubmit={handleAddPayment}  // ❌ Wrong prop name
  patients={patients}
/>
```

The `AddPaymentModal` component expects `onSave` prop but was receiving `onSubmit`.

## 🛠️ Solution Applied

Changed `onSubmit` to `onSave` to match the modal's expected props:

✅ **Fixed**:
```javascript
<AddPaymentModal
  visible={showAddModal}
  onClose={() => setShowAddModal(false)}
  onSave={handleAddPayment}  // ✅ Correct prop name
  patients={patients}
/>
```

## 🎯 Technical Details

The `AddPaymentModal` component is defined as:
```javascript
const AddPaymentModal = ({ visible, onClose, onSave, patients = [] }) => {
  // ...
  onSave(paymentData); // This was failing because onSave was undefined
}
```

When the modal tried to call `onSave()`, it was undefined because the parent was passing `onSubmit` instead.

## 🚀 Result

- ✅ Payment modal now works properly
- ✅ No more "onSave is not a function" errors
- ✅ Payment creation functionality restored
- ✅ Props now correctly aligned between parent and child components

The PaymentManagementScreen can now successfully create new payments without crashes!
